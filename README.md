# sandbox-environment
Some general testing for new technologies or languages to learn concepts.

Every new technology or programming language (e.g typescript) would be stored as a folder under its respective name with each file having its specific exercise as its filename.

So the directory would be /sandbox-environment/typescript/ex1_variables.ts where ex1 means exercise 1 and variables is the concept to learn. 

This project is to help speed up development, often at times where i forget syntax and require a quick 'refresh'. Having the concepts and syntax already listed within separate files will help me a lot when doing projects that require a quick script (i.e such as writing a quick frida script for attaching to a process or a bash script to prepare a mongo databas with predefined collections / data). 

## Goals
- Bash
- NodeJS (In Depth)
