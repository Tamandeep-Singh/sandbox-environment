# sandbox-environment
Some general testing for new technologies or languages to learn concepts.


Every new technology or programming language (e.g typescript) would be stored as a folder under its respective name with each file having its specific exercise as its filename.

So the directory would be /sandbox-environment/typescript/ex1_variables.ts where ex1 means exercise 1 and variables is the concept to learn. 

Goals:
-Bash
-NodeJS (In Depth)
